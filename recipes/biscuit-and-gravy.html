           <strong> <li>1 (16 ounce) package maple-flavored breakfast sausage </li></strong>
            <strong><li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed </li></strong>
            <strong><li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk </li></strong>
            <strong><li>1 ½ cups milk </li></strong>
            <strong><li>½ teaspoon salt </li></strong>
            <strong><li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li></strong>
            <strong><li>1 teaspoon butter </li></strong>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <em><li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li></em>
            <em><li>Arrange biscuits about 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet.</li></em>
            <em><li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes. Slice cooked biscuits in half crosswise and keep warm.</li></em>
    <em><li>While biscuits are baking, crumble sausage into a large skillet over medium heat; cook, breaking meat apart, until no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle sausage and pan drippings with flour and cook and stir until sausage is coated, about 1 more minute. Reduce heat to medium-low.</li></em>
            <em><li>Pour evaporated milk into sausage mixture, followed by milk; stir until thoroughly combined. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until gravy is your desired thickness, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Stir butter into gravy until melted. Stir in more flour if gravy isn't thick enough.</li></em>
            <em><li>Place biscuits with cut sides up on serving plates; top with sausage gravy.</li></em>
        </ol>
